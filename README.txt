The Swiftype Search plugin replaces the standard WordPress search with a better search engine that is fully customizable via the Swiftype dashboard.

== Description ==

The Swiftype Search plugin replaces the standard WordPress search with a better, more relevant search engine. It also gives you detailed insight into what your users are searching for, so you know which keywords to target when customizing your search engine results. The base ranking algorithm is based on industry best-practices and provides more relevant results by default, but we also allow for any result set to be fully customized via our drag-and-drop interface for result reordering. To make customizations you simply create a Swiftype account and install our the Swiftype Search plugin. You can then login to our dashboard to customize results and read through detailed search analytics. See the short demo video below for more details.
